# Programacao2

Projects developed for the **Programming 2** course (academic year 2020/2021).

All projects were implemented in **C**. This repository contains the implemented modules/algorithms **as well as** the necessary `main` and **test files**, so you can compile and run everything locally.

## Projects

### 1st Project
- Implementation of **linear data structures** (linked lists, queues, stacks).
- Algorithms for **insertion, removal, search, and iteration**.
- Tested with the input/output test files included in the repository.

### 2nd Project
- Implementation of **more complex data structures** (trees, graphs, or hash tables).
- Algorithms for **searching, sorting, and dynamic memory management**.
- Also tested with the included test files.
